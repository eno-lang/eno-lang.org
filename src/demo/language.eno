Hello: World

# Reference examples

## Comments

-- markdown
The example is explained through comments within the document below.
-- markdown

-- eno
> This is a comment

> A comment always has its own line
  
  > Nothing except whitespace can come before a comment
  
      > There can be any number of whitespace before a comment

> Comments can also be empty:
>

-- eno

## Fields

-- markdown
The example is explained through comments within the document below.
-- markdown

-- eno
> A field has a name and a value
language: eno

> The value does not reach beyond the line
language:|<--- eno --->|

> The value can be empty
language:

> Whitespace outside of and between name, operator and value is ignored
language:eno
  language  :  eno  
  
> As you see above, multiple fields with the same name are possible,
> whether they are allowed is decided by the application.

> Anything goes after the name operator (:)
This is a sentence: It was a night full of ‚≠ês and ü§ñs in ÏÑúÏö∏ÌäπÎ≥ÑÏãú!

> Almost anything goes before the name operator too
It was a night full of ‚≠ês and ü§ñs in ÏÑúÏö∏ÌäπÎ≥ÑÏãú!: That was a sentence.

> Some things are not allowed in the name, they need to be escaped
`The : in a name needs to be escaped`: The : in a value is fine

> Here's everything that needs to be escaped in a name, and why:

`1:0`: At the first : the name ends, it always needs to be escaped

A-Z: The - is fine when it's preceded by something else
`-AZ`: The - at the start would start a list item

A # of things : The # is fine if it does not start the name
`# of things`: The # at the start would start a section

Php\Namespace : The \ is fine if it's not the first non-whitespace character
`\Php\Namespace`: The \ at the start would start a line continuation

Left|Right : The | is fine if it's not the first character in the name
`|Right`: The | at the start would start a newline continuation

Greater > Smaller: The > is fine if it's not the first thing in the name
`> Smaller`: The > at the start would start a comment
-- eno

## Lists

-- markdown
The example is explained through comments within the document below.
-- markdown

-- eno
> An empty list
my_list:


> A list with a single value
my_list:
- my value


> A list with two values
my_list:
- my value
- my value


my_list:

> There can be comments and any number of empty lines between list items
- my value

- my value


my_list:
- my value
> You can use line and newline continuations for list items just like with fields
\ continued


> Just for clarity, this is NOT a list, but a field with the value "- my value"
NOT_a_list: - my value

-- eno

## Sections

-- markdown
The example is explained through comments within the document below.
-- markdown

-- eno
> A section called my_section
# my_section


> There is no syntactic differentiation between a section and a list of
> sections, you just provide multiple sections with the same name if you need
> multiple sections (applications define and validate the structure of your
> document through the eno library API, so they know what they get anyway)
# my_section
# my_section


> A section nested within the last my_section above
## my_subsection


> A section that is sibling to my_subsection above
## my_sibling_subsection


> A section that is nested within my_sibling_subsection
### my_subsection

> You can go indefintely deeper, but only one layer (#)
> deeper at a time, the following would be an error:
> ##### my_subsection


> A section that is sibling to my_section above
# my_sibling_section


> This is possible - a section called #my_section
# #my_section


> This would be a nested section called my_section however
##my_section

# Real usecase examples

## eno's javascript benchmark suite data

-- markdown
This (generated) file just stores a simple hierarchy with numerical data,
there is a top-level section 'javascript' with some metadata
('iterations', 'evaluated'), as well as a number of subsections,
whose names ('abstract_hierarchy', ...) identify the respective
benchmark scenario and contain a mapping between library name
and measured time, represented as fields.

The rendered markdown report generated on the basis of this data can be studied at:
https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/blob/master/README.md

## A record for an institution from the file-based d√©rive (http://derive.at/) research database

-- markdown
This specific record is from an archive collection documenting players in the
field of urban studies. There are simple fields for the name, place and
website, a list element with tags, and at the bottom two blocks that embed
longer text descriptions. The field names are german because the database
principally consists of german language content and is maintained by german
native speakers - eno allows working with documents that can be fully authored
in any language, as it allows the full unicode range in keys too.

## Deployment configuration for an automated publishing system (anonymized)

-- markdown
This configuration file specifies a `defaults` section
which holds a 'host' and 'user' field. The 'defaults' are
copied into the actual deployment configuration entries,
so they don't need to be repeated, while still remaining
customizable for single entries too.
-- markdown
