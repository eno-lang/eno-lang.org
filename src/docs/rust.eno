-- intro
The official Rust library for eno is currently in development!

```rust
// Don't try this at home yet - it's just a teaser :)

fn main() {
    let input = String::from("when: 2019");

    let document = enors::parse(&input);
    let when = document.string("when").unwrap();
    
    println!("It's coming {}", when);
}
```
