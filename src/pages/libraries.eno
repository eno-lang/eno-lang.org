# Libraries

All libraries are built upon custom, dependency-free, pure parser implementations.
The growing [benchmark suite](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) indicates that eno
parsers by now already outperform most popular toml/yaml parsers in their respective lanugage,
even keeping up with parsers utilizing native C library bindings.

The current main objective for development is to reach full test coverage for
all platforms - currently 96% (js) 90% (py) 92% (rb), and to confirm full
production stability in all running case studies.

## Roadmap for further implementations

Go and Java are likely followup candidates, but what lands on the definite roadmap will also depend on your
feedback, so make yourself heard if you have suggestions or questions!

## Benchmarks

The eno benchmark suite evaluates the performance of all eno libraries, also in comparism
against other popular libraries for parsing yaml and toml.

Visit [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) to study these.

## Interactive Demos

This is a work in progress effort to showcase different usecases for eno and the
eno libraries as interactive demos in the browser. Right now there is only a
limited selection of early demos and a draft page layout.

## Experimental loaders

For each of the core eno implementations there is also an additional
*experimental loaders* project, where new loaders are tested and evaluated. These
loaders will from time to time migrate into the core libraries if they are found
to be really useful and well enough implemented. Feel free to use the
experimental loaders as an expansion package, they are carefully crafted and
unit-tested just like the core libraries themselves!
