Eno is a human-centric data language. Its simple syntax and versatile nature
serves a wide audience, both in regards to cultural background as well as
technical ability. Unlike traditional developer- and machine-centric data
languages, its type-agnostic design acknowledges the human ability to understand
and use context and puts long-lasting user productivity before short-lived
developer convenience.

- [Playground](/playground/) - Example documents you can interactively modify and study.
- [Specification](/specification/) - Encoding, extension, MIME type and implementation details.

# Libeno - C Reference Parser

A new reference parser for eno notation - [currently in development](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/libeno).


# Enolib - Multi-Language Parsing Library

```javascript
import enolib from 'enolib';

const document = enolib.parse(`
  author: Jane Doe
  title:
`);

document.field('author').requiredStringValue();
  // returns 'Jane Doe'
  
document.field('title').requiredStringValue();
  // throws "The field 'title' must contain a value.
  //
  //   Line | Content
  //      1 | author: Jane Doe
  // >    2 | title:
  //
```

Blazing fast, dependency-free, fully localized parsers with built-in validation.

<!--
  - Dynamically extensible query API for custom and third party type support
  - Cursor lookup API (by index or line/column) for easy authoring of rich IDE plugins
  - Querying equals validating - guaranteed data structure and type-safety
  - Fully localized, handwritten, team-friendly error messages
  - Rich error metadata: message, document snippet, cursor position, selection range
-->

- [Benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) - Performance comparison against toml and yaml parsers
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/enolib/) - JavaScript package
- [Playground](/enolib/playground/) - Interactive code examples

# History

The first draft for what is now known as eno notation was sketched out in early
2018 during R&D on a large publishing project around file-based content.  It was
designed and developed by [Simon Repp](https://simonrepp.com/), and still is to
this day. Many contributions were made by people who have offered their
cultural, technical and personal insight, reported bugs and submitted code and
corrections and set out to develop their own libraries for eno notation - I'd
like to hereby express my gratitude to all of you, thank you for being part of
this adventure.


# Present And Future

As of early summer 2020 major efforts are made to enable eno notation usage in
native development (C, C++, Go, Rust, et al). Therein the development of a new
C-based reference parsing library will serve as a vehicle for clearly specifying
and thereby resolving the last remaining ambiguities in the specification.

Building on top of the new reference parser, research on a native and
cross-platform parsing code generator is planned for the near future, enabling
developers to obtain fully functional data serialization code for multiple
languages based on a schema language that is to be defined in the process.

The mid and long term vision is to endeavour for standardization of eno notation
either by institutional backing or through establishment of a de-facto standard
through the power of community. If you sympathize with this vision, I invite you
to the join into our endeavour and help make it happen.
