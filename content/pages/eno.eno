# The eno notation language

eno is a structured, plain-text notation language, related in many ways to its
ancestors and relatives JSON, YAML, TOML, ArchieML, StrictYAML, and others.
Through its simple syntax and versatile nature it targets a wide audience, both
in regards to cultural background as well as technical ability. As a modern
foundational technology for file-based content it enables highly productive and
reliable application development, and the possibility to create file-based
content applications for a wider and more diverse user audience than was
previously possible.
