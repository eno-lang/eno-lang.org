# The eno notation language

eno is a structured, plain-text notation language, related in many ways to its
ancestors and relatives JSON, YAML, TOML, ArchieML, StrictYAML, and others.
Through its simple syntax and versatile nature it targets a wide audience, both
in regards to cultural background as well as technical ability. Backed by
officially maintained, thoroughly engineered open source libraries and plugins
it allows usage on a wide variety of platforms and for many, diverse usecases.
As a modern foundational technology for file-based content it enables highly
productive and reliable application development, and the possibility to
create file-based content applications for a wider and more diverse user audience than
was previously possible.

Â¹ Specification resources are currently spread between here and the [eno
language repository](https://github.com/eno-lang/eno), eventually most content
will probably be made available centrally at the website only, where it can be
presented in a more readable and accessible manner, while still being open for
contribution and discussion via the website repository  and issue tracker.
