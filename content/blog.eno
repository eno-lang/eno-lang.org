  This release introduces a dependency-injection based reporter architecture, which is a **breaking change
  in case you are specifying a custom reporter in your code** - the [changelog](https://github.com/eno-lang/enojs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
  provides instructions on what needs to be changed in that case.
  
  The gain of this is the possibility for users to implement custom reporters, consistency with the other eno libraries (which all use
  dependency injection for their reporters) and as a collateral bonus it resolves an issue when using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  to bundle up eno in a web stack.

- Yet another enojs release (0.17.1) fixing an issue in the grammar matching core which can lead to a specific invalid line pair getting faultily tokenized instead of triggering an error. The patch will be ported to enophp, enopy and enorb in the next days, which also employ the flawed matching pattern.

**`Dictionary` elements are now called `Fieldset` elements.** This change was
long in the making, addressing a few issues and improving a few aspects of the
original terminology, e.g.: Conceptually, sections are dictionaries as well (in
the generic sense of the term), so this was rather ambiguous. Fieldset indicates
the strong relation to fields - it's really just a way of grouping fields - whereas
dictionary possibly indicated some larger, non-existant difference. Fieldset as a term
also hints at fieldsets in HTML and forms in general, which is also desired because
it's a more user-facing and user-friendly wording and concept.

Note that in the eno language context this is purely a non-functional change, it only
modifies how the language construct is referred to in documentation, error messages,
and by the APIs, but it does not change the way fieldsets/dictionaries work in any way.

- Updated the advanced language guide on the website to use the new fieldset terminology.
